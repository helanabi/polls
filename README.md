Full-stack web application where users can create and vote on polls.

## Motivation ##

This is a proof-of-concept project demonstrating several modern web develpment techniques (listed below).

It especially proves the readiness of current Web APIs in making a fairly sophisticated single-page-application with a clean code-base without reliance on third party libraries and frameworks.  The exception to this is usage of SPA-utils (see below), which is developed for this very end (consult [it's documentation](https://github.com/helanabi/spa-utils#readme) for more on that).

## Tech Stack ##

* PostgreSQL
* Node.js / Express
* [SPA-utils](https://github.com/helanabi/spa-utils)

## Main Features ##

* Modern architecture: Backend API / Frontend SPA
* Ergonomic development environment based on [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* Automated build process that offers:
    * Support for old browsers through [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
    * Reduced production bundle size through minification
* Automated testing
* Multi-language support
* User registration with E-mail verification
